# JavaScript Lab 2 Tasks

This repository contains JavaScript scripts for three different tasks. Each task is implemented in a separate script file.

## Example 1:
### Task Description:
Ask the user to enter their age. Validate the user input (positive numbers only). Show the user's status based on age:
- Child: 1-10
- Teenager: 11-18
- Grown up: 19-50
- Old: greater than 50

**Instructions:**
1. Run the script file `ex1.js`.
2. The program will prompt the user to enter their age.
3. The program will continue to ask for age until the user clicks cancel.
4. The output will be displayed in prompts.

## Example 2:
### Task Description:
Ask the user to enter a string. Count the number of vowels (a, e, o, u, i) in that string.

**Instructions:**
1. Run the script file `ex2.js`.
2. The program will prompt the user to enter a string.
3. The program will display the number of vowels in the entered string in a prompt.

## Example 3:
### Task Description:
Write a JavaScript program to convert the 24-hour clock to the 12-hour clock, adding "AM" or "PM" based on its value.

**Instructions:**
1. Run the script file `ex3.js`.
2. The program includes examples for conversions:
   - `0` -> `12AM`
   - `11` -> `11AM`
   - `13` -> `1PM`
3. The output will be displayed in prompts.

## Running the Scripts:
1. Uncomment the script(s) you want to run in the `index.html` file.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Open the browser's developer console (usually F12 or right-click and inspect).
4. The console will display prompts with the output of the selected script.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these scripts for your JavaScript practice.
