In JavaScript, there are no native constructs for defining abstract classes or interfaces like in languages such as Java or C#. 
However, you can achieve similar functionality using different patterns and practices. Below, 

This is an explanations for abstract classes and interfaces in JavaScript

1- Abstract Classes in JavaScript
An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes. It cannot be instantiated ( create object from it ) 
and often contains abstract methods that must be implemented by derived classes

2- Interfaces in JavaScript
JavaScript doesn't have native support for interfaces, but you can simulate them using object literals or TypeScript
