# Login Page with User Input Validation

This project is a simple login page with user input validation using JavaScript. The goal is to ensure that the user enters a valid email and password following specific criteria.

## User Input Validation Criteria

- **Email:**
  - The user should enter a valid email address.

- **Password:**
  - The password must contain at least 8 characters.
  - The password should include a combination of small letters, capital letters, and numbers.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Enter your email and password in the provided input fields.

3. Click the "Submit" button to validate your input.

4. If the input is valid, the form will submit the request. If not, a detailed error message will guide you on correcting the issues.

## Input Validation Details

- If the email is not valid, an error message will be displayed, prompting the user to enter a valid email address.

- If the password is less than 8 characters or lacks a combination of small letters, capital letters, and numbers, an error message will guide the user on correcting the password.
