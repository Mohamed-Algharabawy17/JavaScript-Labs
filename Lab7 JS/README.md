# Login Page and Todo List App

## Part 1: Login Page

### Description
Create a login page where the user enters a username and password. Upon clicking the login button, a JavaScript object named `login` will hold the entered data. If the entered username is 'admin' and the password is '123', display a "Welcome" message; otherwise, show a "Not registered" message. Avoid using `alert` or `prompt` and instead use the DOM to interact with the user.

### Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Fill in the username and password fields.
3. Click the "LOGIN" button.

### Implementation
- The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the login page.
- The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for the page.
- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles user input, object creation, and message display.

## Part 2: Todo List App

### Description
Create a Todo List app where users can add tasks, mark them as done, and delete them.

### Instructions
1. Open `todo.html` in your browser.
2. Enter a task name in the input field.
3. Click the "Add Task" button to add the task to the list.
4. To mark a task as done, click the green checkmark.
5. To delete a task, click the delete button next to it.

### Implementation
- The HTML file (`todo.html`) contains the structure of the Todo List app.
- The CSS file (`style.css`) provides styling for the app.
- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles task addition, status updates, and deletion.
