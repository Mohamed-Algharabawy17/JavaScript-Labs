# JavaScript Lab 3 Tasks

This project contains scripts for Lab1 and Lab2 in separate folders (part1 and part2). Each folder includes two JavaScript scripts (Lab1.js and Lab2.js).

## How to Run

1. Open the `index.html` file in the parent folder (Lab3) using a web browser.

2. To run a specific script, uncomment the corresponding script in the `index.html` file.

    - For part 1 scripts:
      ```html
      <!-- <script src="part1/Lab1.js"></script> -->
      <!-- <script src="part1/Lab2.js"></script> -->
      ```

    - For part 2 scripts:
      ```html
      <!-- <script src="part2/Lab1.js"></script> -->
      <!-- <script src="part2/Lab2.js"></script> -->
      ```

3. Save the `index.html` file after uncommenting the desired script.

4. Reload the HTML file in the web browser.

5. Open the browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect," then navigating to the "Console" tab) to view script outputs.
